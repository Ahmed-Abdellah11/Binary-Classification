# Binary Classification 


Typically, binary classification tasks involve one class that is the normal state and another class that is the abnormal state.

For example In this project we will be working with a fake advertising data set, indicating whether a particular internet user clicked on an Advertisement (1) or not (0). We will try to create a model that will predict whether or not they will click on an ad based off the features of that user


Popular algorithms that can be used for binary classification include:

* Logistic Regression
* k-Nearest Neighbors
* Decision Trees
* Support Vector Machine
* Random Forest Classifier

Some algorithms are specifically designed for binary classification and do not natively support more than two classes; examples include Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines.

But in This Project we will use :
* Logistic Regression
* k-Nearest Neighbors
* Random Forest Classifier

This data set contains the following features:

* 'Daily Time Spent on Site': consumer time on site in minutes
* 'Age': cutomer age in years
* 'Area Income': Avg. Income of geographical area of consumer
* 'Daily Internet Usage': Avg. minutes a day consumer is on the internet
* 'Ad Topic Line': Headline of the advertisement
* 'City': City of consumer
* 'Male': Whether or not consumer was male
* 'Country': Country of consumer
* 'Timestamp': Time at which consumer clicked on Ad or closed window
* 'Clicked on Ad': 0 or 1 indicated clicking on Ad
